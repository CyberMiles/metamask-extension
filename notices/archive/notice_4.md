Dear Venus Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake Venus window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. Venus will never open itself in this way and users are encouraged to report these instances immediately to our support email at [support@cybermiles.io](mailto:support@cybermiles.io).
